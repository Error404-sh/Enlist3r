# Enlist3r
ENLIST3r is my first python project that searches for the subdomains and ip address of a given target url. This is a security recon tool helpful to both website owners and penetration testers. Please note that this tool is meant for education purposes only and the developer will not take any responsibilities for the damage caused by this tool.
